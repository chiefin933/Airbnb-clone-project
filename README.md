# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb’s booking system. This project provides learners with hands-on experience in backend development, database design, API integration, security, and deployment. The goal is to simulate a real-world software development workflow using modern technologies.

### Project Goals
- Learn to work in a collaborative development environment using GitHub.
- Understand backend systems and scalable database architecture.
- Implement and secure RESTful APIs.
- Automate deployment with CI/CD pipelines.
- Build a feature-rich and secure booking platform.

## Team Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Backend Developer** | Designs and implements server-side logic using Django and REST APIs. |
| **Frontend Developer** | (Optional) Builds user interfaces, if applicable. |

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Role in Project |
|------------|------------------|
| **Django** | Backend web framework used to build and manage RESTful APIs and application logic. |
| **PostgreSQL / MySQL** | Relational database system to store user, property, booking, and payment data. |
| **GraphQL** | API query language to enable efficient and flexible data fetching (optional/advanced). |
| **Docker** | Containerization tool to ensure consistent development and deployment environments. |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD tool to automate testing and deployment pipelines. |
| **Nginx / Gunicorn** | Deployment stack for serving the Django app in production. |

## Database Design

### Key Entities & Relationships

#### 1. **Users**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (host, guest)

#### 2. **Properties**
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`
- `owner_id` (FK → Users)

#### 3. **Bookings**
- `id`
- `user_id` (FK → Users)
- `property_id` (FK → Properties)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`

#### 4. **Reviews**
- `id`
- `booking_id` (FK → Bookings)
- `rating`
- `comment`

#### 5. **Payments**
- `id`
- `booking_id` (FK → Bookings)
- `amount`
- `payment_method`
- `payment_status`

> **Relationships**:
- A **user** can own multiple **properties**.
- A **user** can make multiple **bookings**.
- Each **booking** is linked to one **property**.
- Each **booking** can have one **review** and one **payment**.

## Feature Breakdown

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **User Management** | Enables user registration, login, and profile management. |
| **Property Management** | Hosts can list, edit, and remove their properties. |
| **Booking System** | Guests can search for properties, check availability, and make bookings. |
| **Review System** | Guests can leave ratings and feedback after stays. |
| **Payment Integration** | Supports processing and tracking of payments (mock or real gateway). |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Allows for management and moderation of users, bookings, and content. |

## API Security

To secure the backend APIs:

- **Authentication**:
  - Use token-based authentication (JWT).
  - Protect routes to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Authorization**:
  - Restrict access based on user roles (e.g., only hosts can create properties).
  
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Prevent abuse of endpoints with too many requests.

- **Input Validation**:
  - Sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

> **Why it's important**:
- Protects sensitive user data.
- Prevents fraud and abuse.
- Ensures a safe and trusted user experience.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** automates the testing and deployment of your app.
- Helps reduce human error and makes updates faster and safer.

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates tasks like linting, testing, and deploying.
- **Docker**: Packages the app in a container for consistent environments.
- **Heroku / Render / DigitalOcean**: Hosting and deployment platforms.

> With CI/CD, every time code is pushed to GitHub, it is automatically tested and can be deployed to staging or production.
